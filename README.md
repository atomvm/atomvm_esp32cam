# AtomVM ESP32 Camera Driver

This AtomVM Port and Erlang library can be used to control ESP32 cameras on the ESP32 SoC for any Erlang/Elixir programs targeted for AtomVM on the ESP32 platform.

This driver is included as an add-on to the AtomVM base image.  In order to use this Port in your AtomVM program, you must be able to build the AtomVM virtual machine, which in turn requires installation of the Espressif IDF SDK and tool chain.

Documentation for this component can be found in the following sections:

* [Example Program](examples/esp32cam_example/README.md)
